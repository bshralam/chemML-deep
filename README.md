# chemML-deep: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Demonstrations

1) Objective: A collection of Jupyter notebooks and datasets used for demonstrating various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) concepts. 
This repository includes examples from classical machine learning with Scikit-learn to deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with PyTorch.

2) Notebooks:This repository contains the following key Jupyter Notebooks:

- mol_pandas_sklearn.ipynb: Demonstrates classical machine learning techniques for (presumably) chemical or molecular data, leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-learn for modeling.
- pytorch_DL.ipynb: An introduction to building deep learning models using PyTorch.
- pytorch_CNN.ipynb: A specific example of implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch.
