# chemML-deep: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Demonstrations

1) Objective: A collection of Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating various machine learning and deep learning concepts. 

2) Notebooks:
- mol_pandas_sklearn.ipynb: Demonstrates pandas utility and classical machine learning techniques, including linear and logistic regression.
- pytorch_DL.ipynb: Demonstrates building both simple linear regression models from scratch (with a manual optimization loop) and deep learning models with linear and non-linear neural networks.
- pytorch_CNN.ipynb: A specific example of implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch.

3) Tools used : Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, matplotlib, seaborn.
